Calculating the GC content of a DNA file
========================================
Samuel wrote in his blog (http://saml.rilspace.org/calculating-gc-content-in-python-and-d-how-to-get-10x-speedup-in-d) about calculating the number of occurrences of special chars in a 50MB+ file.

I don't have any clues about DNA files, but what makes it interesting is that he compared the speed of various programming languages like Python, D, C++, Go, Free Pascal and even Nimrod.

So this is my attempt to compare the speed of the same program written in OOC (http://www.ooc-lang.org).
